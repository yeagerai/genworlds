    "### Description and Functionalities of the Local Storage Bucket Object\n",
    "The `LocalStorageBucket` object aims to manage file conversions and local storage in a specific use case. It comprises of both actions and events to fulfill its functionalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see the code you can go to `objects/local_storage_bucket.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the parts of this object:\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Definition: `LocalStorageBucket`\n",
    "* Purpose: Consolidate various document types into a single `.txt` file and store it locally.\n",
    "* Attributes:\n",
    "    * `storage_path`: Specifies the local path where files are stored.\n",
    "    * `actions`: Contains instances of possible actions this object can perform. In this case, it is capable of converting documents within a folder to a `.txt` file.\n",
    "* Initialization: When instantiated, this object receives an id and optionally a storage_path, which defaults to the current directory (`\"./\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Event: `AgentRequestsFolderConversion`\n",
    "* Type: `\"agent_requests_folder_conversion\"`\n",
    "* Purpose: This event signals a request from an agent to convert all supported document types in a specific folder into a single `.txt` file.\n",
    "* Attributes:\n",
    "    * `input_folder_path`: Path to the folder containing documents to be converted.\n",
    "    * `output_file_path`: Path where the resulting .txt file should be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Event: `FolderConversionCompleted`\n",
    "* Type: `\"folder_conversion_completed\"`\n",
    "* Purpose: To notify the agent when the folder's documents have been successfully converted and stored into a `.txt` file.\n",
    "* Attributes:\n",
    "    * `output_txt_path`: The path where the output .txt file is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Action: `ConvertFolderToTxt`\n",
    "* Trigger Event: `AgentRequestsFolderConversion`\n",
    "* Purpose: To convert all documents of supported types in a specified folder into a single `.txt` file.\n",
    "* Execution:\n",
    "    Upon calling this action, it iterates over all files in the input_folder_path (specified in the triggering event).\n",
    "    Depending on the file extension (`.md`, `.docx`, or `.pdf`), it reads and extracts text content from each file.\n",
    "    All extracted texts are concatenated and saved into a single `.txt` file at `output_txt_path`.\n",
    "    After conversion, it sends a `FolderConversionCompleted` event, notifying the agent about the completion and providing the path of the newly created `.txt` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note on Document Types:\n",
    "* `.md` (Markdown): Reads and extracts text directly.\n",
    "* `.docx` (Word): Extracts text from each paragraph and concatenates them.\n",
    "* `.pdf` (PDF): Extracts text from each page and concatenates them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note on Action Workflow:\n",
    "When an `AgentRequestsFolderConversion` event is detected, `ConvertFolderToTxt` is triggered, processing documents in the specified folder and then signaling completion through a `FolderConversionCompleted` event.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Utilization:\n",
    "1. Instantiation: `LocalStorageBucket` is created with a unique id and optionally a `storage_path`.\n",
    "2. Action Triggering: An agent sends an `AgentRequestsFolderConversion` event to instruct the `LocalStorageBucket` to convert documents.\n",
    "3. Conversion and Notification: Documents are converted, and a `FolderConversionCompleted` event is subsequently issued to inform the agent of task completion and provide the path to the consolidated .txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This object plays a role in managing document conversion, interaction with the agent through events, and local storage management in a foundational example, showcasing basic functionality and event-driven communication within the GenWorlds framework. It's essential to expand on these foundational concepts for implementing advanced functionalities in real-world applications."

    "### Description and Functionalities of the Qdrant Bucket Object\n",
    "The `QdrantBucket` object represents a specialized object designed to manage interactions with a Qdrant vector store. This object is developed to handle several operations like generating text chunk collections, named entity recognition (NER) collections, and retrieving chunks based on similarity. Derived from an abstract object class, `QdrantBucket` is designed to be capable of executing various actions and responding to or triggering events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again to look at the code of the `QdrantBucket` object, you can go to `objects/qdrant_bucket.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components:\n",
    "* `VectorStoreCollectionCreated` and `VectorStoreCollectionCreationInProcess`:\n",
    "    - Events that notify about the creation and ongoing creation process of a new collection in the Qdrant vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `AgentGeneratesTextChunkCollection` and `AgentGeneratesNERCollection`:\n",
    "    - Events that indicate an agent’s intention to perform actions such as generating a text chunk collection and named entity recognition collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GenerateTextChunkCollection` and `GenerateNERCollection`:\n",
    "    - Actions (inherited from AbstractAction) triggered by respective events, which perform operations like creating a text chunk collection and a named entity recognition collection in a threaded manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `VectorStoreCollectionRetrieveQuery` and `VectorStoreCollectionSimilarChunks`:\n",
    "    - Events to signal a query for retrieving chunks from a Qdrant collection and provide similar chunks from a collection based on a query, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `RetrieveChunksBySimilarity`:\n",
    "    - An action that retrieves a list of text chunks from a Qdrant collection similar to a given query and sends an event with those chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Execution Flow Overview:\n",
    "1. Generating Text Chunk Collection:\n",
    "    * Trigger: The `AgentGeneratesTextChunkCollection` event.\n",
    "    * Action: The `GenerateTextChunkCollection` action responds and creates text chunks, possibly store them using Qdrant, and then sends a VectorStoreCollectionCreated event upon completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generating NER Collection:\n",
    "    * Trigger: The `AgentGeneratesNERCollection` event.\n",
    "    * Action: The `GenerateNERCollection` action responds, extracts named entities and their explanations, converts extracted data to an appropriate format, creates documents and possible embeddings, and finally creates a collection in Qdrant. Then, it sends a `VectorStoreCollectionCreated` event to notify the completion of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Retrieving Similar Chunks:\n",
    "    * Trigger: The `VectorStoreCollectionRetrieveQuery` event.\n",
    "    * Action: The `RetrieveChunksBySimilarity` action responds, retrieves similar chunks to a given query from a collection using Qdrant, and sends a `VectorStoreCollectionSimilarChunks` event containing the retrieved chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-Threading Consideration:\n",
    "In certain actions (like `GenerateNERCollection`), multi-threading is used to avoid socket disconnection due to timeout while performing long operations. A dedicated function that performs the actual operation is called inside a thread, allowing asynchronous execution and not blocking the main thread."
