The `event_type` is a string that identifies the type of event, and the `description` is a human readable description of the event. The `summary` is an optional field that can be used to give a short summary of the event. The `created_at` field is the timestamp of when the event was created. The `sender_id` is the id of the entity that sent the event, and the `target_id` is the id of the entity that the event is targeted to.

The `event_type` is a string that identifies the type of event, and the `description` is a human readable description of the event. The `summary` is an optional field that can be used to give a short summary of the event. The `created_at` field is the timestamp of when the event was created. The `sender_id` is the id of the entity that sent the event, and the `target_id` is the id of the entity that the event is targeted to.
