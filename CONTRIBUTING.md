# Contributing to GenWorlds

Hi there! Thank you for even being interested in contributing to GenWorlds.
As an open source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions, whether they be in the form of new features, improved infra, better documentation, or bug fixes.

## 🚧 This page is under construction

## 🚩 GitHub Issues

Our [issues](https://github.com/yeagerai/genworlds/issues) page is kept up to date
with bugs, improvements, and feature requests.

There is a taxonomy of labels to help with sorting and discovery of issues of interest. Please use these to help
organize issues.

If you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself.

If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single, modular bug/improvement/feature.
If two issues are related, or blocking, please link them rather than combining them.

We will try to keep these issues as up to date as possible, though
with the rapid rate of develop in this field some may get out of date.
If you notice this happening, please let us know.
