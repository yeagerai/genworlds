# Contributing to GenWorlds

Hi there! Thank you for even being interested in contributing to GenWorlds.
As an open source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions!

## General Information
- **Simplicity as the Top Priority:** We strive for code that captures the irreducible complexity of a system/problem in a straightforward, readable, and maintainable manner. Aiming for a solution that is concise and elegant is more valuable than one that is lengthy or overly complex.
- **Avoid Minor Formatting PRs:** Please refrain from creating new PRs solely for formatting.

## How You Can Contribute
- **Bug Fixes:** Given that GenWorlds is in its alpha stage, identifying and fixing bugs is incredibly valuable. If you find a bug, feel free to fix it and submit a PR.
- **Feature Additions:** When adding a new feature, consider its overall complexity and utility. The feature should be generic enough to benefit a wide range of users or fit into an existing utility layer. Remember, the efficiency of the code is key.
- **Refactors:** Refactoring contributions are welcome but be aware that they should offer a clear improvement to be considered. Refactors that don't provide a significant benefit may not be accepted.
- **Tests:** Contributions that add or extend tests are always appreciated as they help ensure the robustness and reliability of the framework.
